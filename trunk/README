Web Tracking For You - Demo Code

This code is for reference purposes and is already outdated.

The latest version should be retrieved from http://code.google.com/p/wtfy/

To run the tools, you will need several Python software packages:

 - tornado
 - DNS
 - adns
 - pyPdf (https://github.com/chr15m/pyPdf.git)

For example, on Ubuntu it is generally enough to use apt-get and git:

   sudo apt-get install python-tornado python-dns python-adns
   git clone https://github.com/chr15m/pyPdf.git pyPdf
   pushd pyPdf
   sudo python setup.py install
   popd

Versions of the following thirdparty packages are included and used as a fallback:

 - tornado
 - DNS
 - pyPdf


*Running*

By default, the local proxy runs on port 8118 and injects content to localhost.

The tracking server should be started with the path to the config file.

Examples, run from the appropriate directory:

   python localproxy.py --bind-port=8123

   sudo python TrackingServer.py config.txt
